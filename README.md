# groovy-microsoft-teams-webhook-integration
Sample code in groovy to integrate with Microsoft Teams. The code sends a sample text message to the API

## Pre-requisite
* You should know what Microsoft Teams tool;
* You should know when and where to use Microsoft Teams;
* You should have basic coding skills in Groovy;
* You should know what is a Channel in Microsoft Teams and how to enable Webhook in the Integration settings;
* And you should know why you even want this integration;

## Note
> You can very well integrate with the API by using simple CURL command or by using POSTMAN. In case, if you are looking for a sample code in a short time instead of writing your own to see how the Code might look like to integrate with the API, then go ahead, check out the Code. If you intend to test the API for once to see if it is working or not, then I would recommend using CURL or POSTMAN. 

## What this code does?
The code is written in Groovy using Unirest library to call the Microsoft Teams webhook API to send a simple text message.
